# Email_Validation
Email validation plays a pivotal role in the success of any company's digital endeavours. It serves as the foundation for enhanced communication by ensuring that emails reach their intended recipients without bouncing back or going undeliverable. By maintaining a clean and accurate email list, the company can significantly improve customer data quality, minimising database errors and streamlining marketing and customer service efforts.

Moreover, the importance of email validation extends to spam reduction, a critical aspect of email marketing. Identifying and removing potential spam traps or invalid addresses enhances the company's reputation and ensures that legitimate emails land in recipients' inboxes, increasing the likelihood of engagement and response.

In this project, we will use regular expressions using Python and SQL on an email data set. 
We will use [email_dataset.csv](email_dataset.csv)

**With Python**
we will get output file as [clean_email_dataset.csv](clean_email_dataset.csv)
**With SQL**
we will get output file as [clean_email_dataset.sql](email_validation_with_SQL/output_file.sql)
