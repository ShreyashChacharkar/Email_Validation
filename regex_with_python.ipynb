    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are made up of both ordinary and special characters. Ordinary characters simply match themselves, while special characters have a more specific meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type | Description | Example |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| **Ordinary character** | Matches itself | `A` matches the letter `A` |\n",
    "| **Special character** | Has a specific meaning | `.` matches any character |\n",
    "| **Quantifier** | Indicates how many times a character or group of characters can be matched | `*` matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character |\n",
    "| **Grouping** | Allows you to group together characters or expressions | `(A|B)` matches either `A` or `B` |\n",
    "| **Escape character** | Escapes the special meaning of a character | `\\.` matches the literal character `.` |\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the regular expression `\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}` matches any string that contains three digits, a hyphen, three more digits, and a hyphen, followed by four digits. This regular expression could be used to match a phone number.\n",

    "## Square Brackets in Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Square brackets (`[]`) are used to specify a group of ordinary characters to search from data. The characters can be listed individually or ranges of characters can be indicated by giving two characters and separating them by a '-'. Special characters lose their special meaning inside sets. For example, `[(+*)]` will match any of the literal characters '(', '+', '*', or ')'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of how square brackets can be used in regular expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `[123]` will match any of the digits 1, 2, or 3.\n",
    "* `[a-z]` will match any of the lowercase letters from a to z.\n",
    "* `[0-9a-zA-Z]` will match any of the digits from 0 to 9, or any of the lowercase or uppercase letters from a to z.\n",
    "* `[^5]` will match any character except '5'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Square brackets can be a powerful tool for matching patterns in text. They can be used to match a wide variety of characters, and they can be used to complement sets of characters.\n",
